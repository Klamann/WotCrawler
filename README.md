# WoT Database Crawler

The WoT Database Crawler is a generic tool to rebuild the internal Vehicle Database
from the popular computer game [World of Tanks](http://worldoftanks.com/) by crawling
the data that is available from the public wiki.

The program creates an XML database that can be used to generate more sophisticated
content analysis (see [examples](http://www.nx42.de/projects/wot/rating.html)).
Basic content analysis and HTML table export are already implemented.
